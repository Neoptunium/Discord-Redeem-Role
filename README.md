# Discord.js-Redeem-Role Infomration

The allows you to have users in your server redeem a role easily and in a fun way rather than the basic click emeoji to message way, this makes the user get do the slash command. I use his for my server so members can redeem cool roles on holidays and other important days. In order for the command to work you have to do the following;

**/redeem**
